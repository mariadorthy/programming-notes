# Programming Notes

This repository is my personal knowledge base for mastering programming concepts from fundamentals to interview level.

It is built as a long-term revision system. 
The goal is not just to write code, but to understand how things behave, where mistakes happen, and how concepts connect across topics and languages. Content will grow step by step as I learn, revisit, correct misunderstandings, and deepen clarity.

## Topics include:

- core language fundamentals
- behavior of data types
- memory and limits
- edge cases
- problem-solving patterns
- interview preparation insights

This is a living document and will continuously improve.
